                    <p>Balcony nets serve a crucial safety purpose in residential buildings. Their primary
                        function is to prevent accidental falls, acting as a protective barrier for residents,
                        especially children and pets. When properly installed, these nets provide peace of mind,
                        allowing people to enjoy their balcony space without worry. Mesh nets, metal railing nets
                        and cable nets are common types, each offering a balance between safety and maintaining an
                        open feel. Beyond safety, balcony nets also provide privacy and can act as a sound barrier.
                        😊🌿🏙️ .

                    <p>Monkey nets, also known as monkey safety nets, serve a specific purpose:
                        they are designed to protect areas from monkeys. These clever and agile creatures can be quite
                        challenging due to their strength and intelligence.
                        Monkey nets act as a physical barrier, creating a boundary that prevents monkeys from intruding
                        into specific areas.
                        Common applications include gardens, balconies,
                        or any space where monkeys might cause damage or pose safety risks 🐒🌿.
